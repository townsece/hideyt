Quick and dirty add-on for firefox to vanish watched videos when extension is clicked in toolbar.

## How to install

Download or clone the repository, then follow the instructions
at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension#installing to apply to
your browser. The file you should select is the manifest.json.

## How to run

Once installed, the extension should show up in your toolbar. Just click the icon while a YouTube tab is loaded to apply
the watched filter. To remove the filter, refresh the page.

The extension has some options for fine-tuning what is hidden; to access these options you can navigate
to `about:addons` and toggle the options in the `Preferences` tab.
